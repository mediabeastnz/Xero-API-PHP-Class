PHP-Xero PHP Wrapper (Partner)
====================

Introduction
------------
A class for interacting with the Xero Partner application API. 
More documentation for Xero can be found at http://blog.xero.com/developer/api-overview/  
It is suggested you become familiar with the API before using this class, otherwise it may not make much sense to you - http://blog.xero.com/developer/api/

I have gathered a bunch of tools from a few people so thank you to all of them (See Authors on github). I have have built onto top of them to provide a easier to use class.

I have included a entire working structure including .sql files for quick implementation and testing.
I have made this public as I found it quite difficult to find any information on using the Xero API (partner). Enjoy!


Issues
-------
This hasn't been fully tested and will require testing before it can be used on a live app.
Leave any issues if you find any, always good to improve.


Requires
--------
PHP5+

Setup
-------

Before this class will work you will have need to have registered a app with Xero and create all the neccessary certificates.
See Xro_config.php for all required settings e.g. cert files, callback url and more.

1. edit Xro_config.php
1.1 set $xro_app_type
1.2 set $oauth_callback to point to authorise.php (ie https://domain.com/authorise.php)
1.3. set consumer_key and shared_secret

XERO APP SETTINGS (https://api.xero.com/Application)
URL of your app: https://[domain]/[path]/authorise.php
OAuth callback domain: [domain]

DATABASE
1. make a new database called "xero"
2. run xero.sql - to import tables i've created for testing.
3. make sure there is 1 row in "xero_api" table with the id of 1 - used to update credentials 


Usage
--------

-- read test.php for examples of usage and testing.

### GET Request usage
Retrieving a result set from Xero involves identifying the endpoint you want to access, and optionally, setting some parameters to further filter the result set.
There are 5 possible parameters:

1. Record filter: The first parameter could be a boolean "false" or a unique resource identifier: document ID or unique number eg: $xero->Invoices('INV-2011', false, false, false, false);
2. Modified since: second parameter could be a date/time filter to only return data modified since a certain date/time eg: $xero->Invoices(false, "2012-05-11T00:00:00");
3. Custom filters: an array of filters, with array keys being filter fields (left of operand), and array values being the right of operand values.  The array value can be a string or an array(operand, value), or a boolean eg: $xero->Invoices(false, false, $filterArray);
4. Order by: set the ordering of the result set eg: $xero->Invoices('', '', '', 'Date', '');
5. Accept type: this only needs to be set if you want to retrieve a PDF version of a document, eg: $xero->Invoices($invoice_id, '', '', '', 'pdf');
